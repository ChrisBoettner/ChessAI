Compiled myself on Habrok

Howto (ChatGPT):

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, it's hard to point to a specific version of Stockfish that would be guaranteed to work with a specific `glibc` version like 2.28. Stockfish's compatibility with a particular `glibc` version will depend on how it was compiled. 

However, Stockfish is open source, which means that if you have the required development tools, you should be able to compile it on your own system, which would create a version of Stockfish compatible with your current `glibc`.

Here's a basic outline of steps you could take:

1. **Install Required Tools**: Install `g++` and `make` if they are not already installed. These are necessary for building C++ applications. You can install them using your package manager. For Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu), you can use:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++ make
```

For Red Hat-based systems (like CentOS), you can use:

```bash
sudo yum install gcc-c++ make
```

2. **Clone the Stockfish Repository**: You can clone the Stockfish source code from the official GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish.git
cd Stockfish/src
```

3. **Compile the Source Code**: You can compile the source code using the `make` command:

```bash
make build ARCH=x86-64
```

This should generate an executable in the `src` directory that is compatible with your `glibc` version. Note that `ARCH=x86-64` specifies the architecture to build for, and you should replace `x86-64` with your actual architecture if it's different.

Please note that the specific steps might change over time as the Stockfish project evolves, so it's always a good idea to check the official documentation or the README files for the most current instructions.
