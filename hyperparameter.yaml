NODE:
  C           : 2       # Hyperparameter balancing exploitation and exploration (in playouts) in PUCT calculation, higher value favours exploration.
MCTS:
  TEMPERATURE : 1       # Temperature parameter that balances exploration and exploitation (in move selection from policy). Higher values lead to more random moves.
  PLAYS       : 25      # Number of playouts.
TRAINING:
  TIME_LIMIT  : 0.01    # Time limit for stockfish evaluation.
  TEMPERATURE : 1       # Temperature parameter that balances exploration and exploitation (in move selection from policy). Higher values lead to more random moves.
  MATE_SCORE  : 100000  # Score associated with board states that lead to a check mate.
