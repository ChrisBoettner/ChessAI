NODE:
  C             : 2        # Hyperparameter balancing exploitation and exploration (in playouts) in PUCT calculation, higher value favours exploration.
MCTS:
  TEMPERATURE   : 1        # Temperature parameter that balances exploration and exploitation (in move selection from policy). Higher values lead to more random moves.
  PLAYS         : 25       # Number of playouts.
TRAINING:
  TEMPERATURE   : 1        # Temperature parameter that balances exploration and exploitation (in move selection from policy). Higher values lead to more random moves.
  TIME_LIMIT    : 0.01     # Time limit for stockfish evaluation.
  MATE_SCORE    : 100000   # Score associated with board states that lead to a check mate.
NEURAL_NETWORK:
  BUFFER_SIZE   : 1000     # Buffer size for dataset shuffling, higher value leads to more uniform shuffle
  BATCH_SIZE    : 16       # Batch size for training
  L2_REG        : 0.001    # L2 regularisation parameter
  LEARNING_RATE : 0.001    # Learning rate for optimizer 
  EPOCHS        : 1000     # Number of epochs
  FILTERS       : 256      # Number of filters in the convolutional layers of the network
  RES_LAYERS    : 19       # Number of residual layers in the network
